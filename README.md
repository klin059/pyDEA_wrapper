# pyDEA wrapper
**pyDEA** (<https://github.com/araith/pyDEA>) is one of the main open-source software for running data envelopment analysis (DEA) 
in Python. It was designed to run with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or through 
the Command Line Interface (CLI) and running pyDEA with Python scripts is not very 
trivial as you will need to dig into the packages and find the methods you want. 

**pyDEA wrapper** provides a wrapper approach to use **pyDEA** in Python scripts. 
It provides a Python class with methods that calls **pyDEA** to solve DEA problems 
as well as some useful functions for post-solution analysis.

## Usage
[Install pyDEA](https://github.com/araith/pyDEA#installation) and put pyDEA_wrapper.py
in the working directory of your DEA project.

Usage illustrated in `pyDEA_wrapper_usage.py`.
