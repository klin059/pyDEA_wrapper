# pyDEA wrapper
**pyDEA** (<https://github.com/araith/pyDEA>) is one of the main open-source software for running data envelopment analysis (DEA) 
in Python. It was designed to run through a graphical user interface or through 
the command line interface. Running pyDEA with Python scripts is not very 
trivial as you will need to dig into the package and find the methods you want. 

**pyDEA wrapper** provides a wrapper approach to use **pyDEA** in Python scripts. 
It defines a Python object with methods that call **pyDEA** to solve DEA problems and provides
some useful functions for post-solution analysis.

## Usage
[Install pyDEA](https://github.com/araith/pyDEA#installation) and put pyDEA_wrapper.py
in the working directory of your DEA project.

Usage illustrated in [`pyDEA_wrapper_usage.py`.](https://github.com/klin059/pyDEA_wrapper/blob/master/pyDEA_wrapper_usage.py)
